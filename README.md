# üí°RMGBackEnd

RMGBackEnd is a backend service built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) that dynamically generates JSX code snippets based on natural language descriptions.  
The service integrates with OpenAI's GPT model to interpret prompts and return relevant, ready-to-use code for predefined UI components.

## Features

- Dynamic JSX code generation based on user input.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT for natural language processing.
- RESTful API endpoint to receive prompts and return a **structured JSON component tree**
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with front-end tools to:
  - Render the UI visually.
  - Copy JSX code.
  - Download the generated code

## Technology Stack

- Node.js (NestJS framework)
- OpenAI API (via `openai` npm package)
- TypeScript
- REST API (Express under the hood)
